## Customized E-Commerce Site

www.foxriverdaylilies.com

This site was built for a client who wanted a clean, intuitive, easy to use and customizable e-commerce site. This is the front end of the project.

## Concepts/Technologies Learned:

```bash
Next.js
React
Typescript
Tailwind
Prisma
MySQL
Cloudinary (SaaS)
Clerk
Stripe
```

This project marks my initial experience with utilizing services such as Cloudinary for image hosting, Stripe for payment processing, and Clerk for authentication. Delegating these critical aspects to reputable third-party services significantly streamlines project development, albeit with an associated financial consideration. In this particular scenario, the client can leverage these services at an initially economical rate. As their business evolves, they retain the flexibility to upgrade their plans, aligning with the expanding needs of their enterprise.
